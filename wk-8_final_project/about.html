                <div id="bio">
                    <p>Eric Johnson is a 43-year-old chorus actor who enjoys extreme ironing, working on cars and watching television. He is gregarious and inscrutable, but can also be very insdidious and a bit demon-possessed.

                    He is American who defines himself as straight. He started college but never finished the course. He has a severe phobia of snakes
                    
                    Physically, Eric is slightly overweight but otherwise in good shape. He is average-height with pale skin, black hair and black eyes.
                    
                    He grew up in a middle class neighbourhood. He was raised by his father, his mother having left when he was young.
                    
                    He is currently married to Shona Elijah Barrett. Shona is the same age as him and works as a lab assistant.
                    
                    Eric has four children with wife Shona: Derrick aged 2, Maia aged 8, Lynda aged 13 and Mustafa aged 18.
                    
                    Eric's best friend is a chorus actor called Livia Houghton. They are inseparable. He also hangs around with Willie Oliver and Gordon Coates. They enjoy vandalising bus stops together.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Eric has two children with ex-girlfriend Monica: Dolly aged 13 and Jerome aged 15.

                        Eric's best friend is a professional sports person called Steve Hunter. They have a very firey friendship. He also hangs around with Darcie Mack and Marc Parker. They enjoy lighting bottle rockets in their armpits. 
                    </p>

                    <p>After fleeing Venzuela because of trouble with the cartel, Eric picked up the violin.  Lying low for years, he found himself in a tumuluos relationship
                        with a carnival groupie named Chazette, who was well known for her only professional virtue of being fired out of a cannon into one of those ball pits that 
                        children often rent for their birthdays.  The primary difference with Chazette's cannon shot escapdes being that it was not related to anyone's birthday,
                        with perhaps the exception of Eric's, which many say is what drew the two together.  Not many people can boast of a relationship cemented on being fired from 
                        a cannon.  Or perhaps not, but then again maybe so.  Regardless, Eric and Chazette had three children: Beatritch aged 22, Gus aged 16, and Leroy age 11.
                    </p>

                    <p>After spending more time in the states, Eric decided that with his violin playing not paying off, it was time to reinvent himself.
                        This was when he took up the new-age lifestyle and shopping at the Sharper Image.  He badly needed supplies to maintain his goat cheese
                        farming operation that he had invested in remotely in China.  Word was getting back on a regular basis that his coveted asian investment
                        would go under anytime unless he kept sending everything he had.  Having already sent all of his savings to a Nigerian prince, he was forced to 
                        burglarize shopping malls using only a diamond for cutting glass, and tweezers.  It was then that he came to the conclusion that it would 
                        be best to finally settle down in suburbia and get a real job, which led him to Grantham University.
