        <h1>Cylce Out Cancer</h1>
        <h3>We ride so others may live</h3>
        <p>How we make a difference: Battling cancer is 
           one of othe most difficult struggles you can 
           possibly imagine.  It isn't something anyone
           should have to do alone.  That's why we ride 
           to cycle out cancer.  Our mission is to raise
           awareness so that the communities surrounding
           our riding groups know there's a place they 
           can go for support.  Our members do more than
           just ride, but being visible as a gathering 
           place for those that want to reach out and 
           help as well as for those that need it, and 
           all the while engaging in an activity like
           cycling that is an opportunity to bond, make
           new friends, and find those that need the help
           we aim to give means cycling out cancer is 
           possible.
